  The drive from Santa Fe to Los Alamos was quick and full of sights. Los Alamos
  sits on top of a mountain and has a very explosive history. Our first stop was
  theBradbury Museum. We learned all about the making of the atomic bomb and the
  history of Los Alamos National Laboratory.From there we explored the town for
  a little bit in search for some atomic bomb souvenirs and then headed
  toBandelier National Monument in Frijoles canyon.We camped in the parking lot
  of the Visitor's Center. They actually had RV camping which was nice. We woke
  up early the next morning ate our breakfast in the EP, bought our park
  entrance tickets and waited for the bus ride up.We had a fabulous time hiking
  around Bandelier and learning about the cliff dwellings we even climbed the
  140ft (up 4 ladders and several stone staircases) to Alcove house.(Checking
  out the view! LOL!)Before leaving Santa Fe we had to make a quick pit stop for
  new hiking boots, paired with our awesome socks that we bought at a boutique
  on the Plaza, just perfect for hiking at Bandelier.(Heading back down the 140
  ft. climb to Alcove house)Anywhere that the boys could romp and run free was
  an excellent stop. The first cliff dwellings that you come to on the hike to
  Alcove house had lot of rocks, holes and tight spots that the kids could have
  played in all day. There was even a little steam that we had to cross that the
  kids enjoyed.
