  When I was a kid history was boring as snot. I had to fight to stay awake in
  class and it wasn’t until college that I finally figured out “my” way of
  getting through it. My brother and I were both fans of Star Trek so of course
  I watched every episode that came on our 5 channel television. I knew who the
  good guys were and who the bad guys were so once in college and taking a
  history class I figured out that if I related what ever battle we were
  studying to Star Trek then at test time I was golden. Who ever the bad guys
  were, in my mind they were the Ramulans and of course you know who the good
  guys were if you were a Trek fan.

# Civil Rights

When I was a kid history was boring as snot. I had to fight to stay awake in class and it wasn't until college that I finally figured out "my" way of getting through it. My brother and I were both fans of Star Trek so of course I watched every episode that came on our 5 channel television. I knew who the good guys were and who the bad guys were so once in college and taking a history class I figured out that if I related what ever battle we were studying to Star Trek then at test time I was golden. Who ever the bad guys were, in my mind they were the Ramulans and of course you know who the good guys were if you were a Trek fan.

Now that I am an adult, at least on most day, I LOVE history and I want my kids to love history so instead of them just reading it in a text book I want to bring it to life for them. 

So here we go time to study Civil Rights and Rosa Parks in particular because that is a big subject in 4th grade the grade that one of my kiddos will be entering this upcoming school year.
