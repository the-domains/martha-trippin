            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Civil Rights</h1><p>When I was a kid history was boring as snot. I had to fight to stay awake in class and it wasn’t until college that I finally figured out “my” way of getting through it. My brother and I were both fans of Star Trek so of course I watched every episode that came on our 5 channel television. I knew who the good guys were and who the bad guys were so once in college and taking a history class I figured out that if I related what ever battle we were studying to Star Trek then at test time I was golden. Who ever the bad guys were, in my mind they were the Ramulans and of course you know who the good guys were if you were a Trek fan.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ad0882f9-cd9b-4322-8e81-1eeef08eb266.jpg"></article>]]></description>
